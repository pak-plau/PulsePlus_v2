Yoo it is team hell_os

Comments:
- You should connect things more on the component map, the html/webpage/js island feels oddly detached. 
- The lines should be arrows and there needs to be writing for the interactions.
- Are y'all 100% sure you want to do this as a one-page thing?
- Be WAY more descriptive! There's not enough explanation in the components section of what you're using and how and why. Also why you're using each api and for what.

The idea looks cool!
